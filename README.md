# Data_Warehouse_Project

Welcome to the **Data_Warehouse_Project** repository! 🚀  
This is a portfolio project that shows how to build a complete data warehouse and turn data into useful insights. It follows best practices in data engineering and analytics.

## 🏗️ Data Architecture

The project is based on the Medallion Architecture, which has three layers:


1. **Bronze Layer**: Stores raw data exactly as it comes from the source (CSV files loaded into a SQL Server database).
2. **Silver Layer**: Cleans and prepares the data by removing errors and formatting it correctly.
3. **Gold Layer**: Contains the final data ready for analysis, organized in a star schema for easy reporting.
